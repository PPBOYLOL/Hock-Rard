### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Unbox All Components**: Carefully lay out all parts in an organized fashion to ensure nothing is missing.
   - Frame: Unfold and lock in place using provided hex key (included in your toolkit).
   - Motor Units: Attach motors to the designated mount points on the frame.
   - **The Rock’s Arm**: Affix the hydraulic arm and ensure it’s calibrated for full 360-degree motion.
   - Weapon Systems: Attach the **Slam-and-Jam** mechanism to the front chassis, and plug it into the primary power distribution unit.
   - **People's Elbow**: Install the elbow assembly on the rear hydraulic piston.
   - Wheelbase: Attach the wheels and tighten with torque wrench to 35 Nm.

## 4. Operating Instructions

### Basic Movements:
- **Forward/Reverse**: Push the right joystick forward or backward.

### Advanced Tactics:

## 5. Combat Modes

**"SmackDown" Mode**: High aggression, enhanced speed, and extra elbow-drop torque. Perfect for finishing off a weakened opponent.

**"Hollywood" Mode**: Tactical mode that emphasizes defense and counterattacks, allowing The Rock to recover quickly and observe enemy movements.

**"WrestleMania" Mode**: The ultimate crowd-pleaser. Expect more showmanship (e.g., extra shouts, eyebrow-raising, and glitter bombs). Less effective in combat, but great for style points.
